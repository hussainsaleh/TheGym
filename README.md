# **Project overview**

In this project, I design and implement a website for a local gym. The website provides information to visitors about the gym; it invites them to join by registering on the website with a verified email, then to select a membership plan and then it processes their payments and activates their membership. 

Moreover, the website enables administrators to manage the content of the website and to manage the users by assigning roles and privileges to them, tracking their memberships, issuing bans and removing them from the system. Each member is allocated a personal page where they can view their membership status and their gym activity.


# **Objective:**

The objective of this project is to meet the requirements of a small gym business. Among these requirements are the following: (*much of the details are omitted for brevity*):
1. Internet users can view the website via desktops and smartphones.
1. The website must provide information about membership prices, opening times, vacancies, gym location and pictures.
1. Visitors can send a message via a Contact Us page.
1. Free one-day pass can be issued via the website.
1. Visitors can register their details on the website.
1. The website allows registered users to select membership plans and pay by debit and credit card.
1. Administrators can manage the content of the website.
1. Administrators can assign roles and privileges to users.
1. Membership statuses are tracked and marked as either active or inactive.
1. Users can be added, edited, banned and removed from the system.
1. Employees are granted free gym memberships.
1. Existing members can renew their memberships by selecting a membership plan and paying by debit and credit card.
1. Payments are processed and handled by a well-established online payment platform.
1. Memberships are only accessible to adults aged 16 and over.

The above list is only meant to outline the main requirements without defining the specifics.


# **Languages and frameworks used:**

The project is built on the latest version of ASP.NET Core MVC framework. This was not a requirement of the project but I chose it for four reasons:
1. It is cross-platform, offering the flexibility to run it on any of the major operating systems.
1. It is free and open source.
1. It is powerful, scalable and backed by an established company, namely Microsoft, and a strong open source community.
1. I have some prior experience developing in C# and have a passion to pursue a career as a .NET developer.

The project also utilises other technologies and frameworks namely:
* Entity Framework Core to build and manipulate the SQL Server database.
* Html and CSS
* Bootstrap framework
* Some JavaScript code to manipulate the DOM where needed.
* Stripe payment processing platform
* MailKit mail-client library
* Azure to host the website


# **Future additions:**

As the gym grows and becomes more established, two additional features my necessitate:
1. Gym classes may be added which will require a system to schedule these classes and subscribe members to them.
1. The gym will sell products such as protein powders and gym accessories to increase revenue. An e-commerce system may be added to expand this line of business.
